# Code for Move It!
Teensyduino (Teensy + Arduino) code for a toy that I helped make in the MIT class 2.00B (Toy Product Design).

Toy name: Move It!

The toy features: a Teensy 3.6 microcontroller, an accelerometer for motion detection, a strip of smart LEDs (OctoWS2811) with solid and rainbow "strobe" modes, and an Audio amplifier/speaker combination for sound.
